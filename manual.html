        <h2 align="center">Introduction </h2>
        <p>Greetings, adventurer! </p>
        <p>Prepare to enter the future worlds of Silicon Dreams,
        where Earth Man has started to colonise the outlying
        reaches of distant galaxies. </p>
        <p>This adventure is a trilogy of Level 9's adventures
        Snowball, Return to Eden, and Worm in Paradise. The
        trilogy retains the highly acclaimed quality of the
        original versions, but now stretches the imagination even
        further with the addition of graphics, extended text
        descriptions, an extremely flexible English-language
        sentence interpreter, and a whole host of user-friendly
        features which allow the player a more versatile means of
        communication. </p>
        <p>For the player new to adventure games, the first part
        of this booklet will explain how to use the keyboard to
        enter the futuristic age of robots, spacecraft,
        inflatable dolls and cute furry animals with lousy senses
        of humour. </p>
        <p>Scenarios have been included to set the scene for each
        adventure in the trilogy, and point you roughly in the
        right direction. Further information on what your
        objectives might be have been included in the
        &quot;Scoring and Hints&quot; section. </p>
        <p>Good fortune on your quest, and remember that to
        succeed, you must show courage, determination, skill,
        cunning, and have a brain the size of a fairly large
        solar system...! </p>

        <h2 align="center">Kim Kimberley </h2>
        <p>Kim is 1.7 metres tall, weighs 55 kilos, is fairly
        intelligent, athletic, and has brown eyes and fair hair.
        Now aged 22, or 25, or 131 years... depending on how you
        calculate these things. </p>
        <p>Born on September 29th, 2172 AD, Kim was raised by the
        Hampstead Creche. This was a peculiar place, set amongst
        decaying buildings, and heavily reliant on a mix of
        relationship-engineering, behaviour conditioning and
        Hell-Fire religion. It was finally closed in 2185 for
        breaches of the Android Protection Acts. It seems to have
        done Kim little harm however, though possibly
        contributing to a tendency towards introversion. </p>
        <p>Then to Milton Keynes School of Life: a fine,
        residential establishment situated (despite its name) in
        Malta. The staff were, in effect, Kim's family. (This
        type of situation, by the way, was far from unusual in
        the late 22nd century. Advances in entertainment and
        travel, plus the sexual revolution resulting from A.I.
        partho and cloning techniques, made a family up-bringing
        the exception.) </p>
        <p>Kim returned to England for National Service before
        progressing to Oxford. Kim proved a good student, and
        established many close relationships, though nothing
        permanent. It was during National Service that the event
        central to the Snowball mission took place, though it
        went unremarked at the time. Kim was approached,
        discreetly, to do security work. Initially, this simply
        involved training and occasional surveillance of possible
        subversives, but it soon developed into
        counter-espionage. </p>
        <p>Then, when the Snowball project got under way, Kim was
        approached to volunteer for the stars. The Snowball craft
        were as near automatic as possible, and carried a trained
        crew in case anything went wrong. But suppose something
        happened to the crew? What was needed were one-or-two
        trained people, carried without the crew's knowledge who
        could emerge and take over if something went really
        wrong. </p>

        <p><a name="siliconterranexpansionaryphase"></a> </p>
        <h2 align="center">Terran Expansionary Phase, 2120-2210 </h2>
        <p>The late 21st Century saw a great increase in space
        travel within the solar system. </p>
        <p>Fusion power was not yet feasible, conventional fuel
        sources were close to running out and the energy needs of
        the industrial nations were ever-increasing. The solution
        lay in space. Solar reflectors, if made large enough,
        could easily concentrate any amount of energy and beaming
        it back to Earth was simplicity itself. </p>
        <p>What was not simple was to transport enough material
        for thousand-mile reflectors into space. Indeed, it was
        much more efficient to use what was already there... and
        thus the first accelerator chains were set up to boost
        asteroid material from beyond Mars into Earth's orbit. </p>
        <p>By 2120, thirty percent of Earth's energy came from
        the space reflectors and the proportion was steadily
        rising. To supply the colossal requirements of the
        orbital industries, the whole Solar System was linked by
        accelerators. </p>
        <p>Then workable fusion power was perfected, and it was
        very cheap. The whole space sector of the economy was
        redundant. A lot of politicians risked looking very silly
        indeed. </p>
        <p>Thus a use for the accelerators, space reflectors and
        orbiting factories had to be found, and Stellar
        Colonisation was it. A lot of voters/party members read
        SF, after all, and colonies are always popular (at first,
        anyway). </p>
        <p>So the accelerators were linked up and fired out of
        tens of thousands of small exploration probes in all
        directions. These robots would coast through space with
        only one mission - as each flashed past a star it would
        report back the existence of Earth-sized planets.
        Unmanned, they could continue for centuries. </p>
        <p>Ten years behind came larger survey craft, each
        clutching a great ball of ammonia ice to power its fusion
        motor. If one was lucky enough to be following a
        successful exploration probe, it had just enough time to
        decelerate (from its coasting speed of 0.3c) before
        reaching the star. Once there it would scout the system
        and if there really were habitable planets (or even ones
        requiring controlled climate domes as long as the ground
        was solid) it would radio the information back to Earth. </p>
        <p>Then, while waiting for the first colonists to join
        it, decades later, the survey craft would proceed to
        prepare a world for them to live in. </p>
        <p>First came a long, slow, painstaking period of
        asteroid mining - assembling the necessary materials to
        build its first robot-production line. The first robot
        would take ten or twenty years, the next ten or twenty
        days and the thousandth would take minutes. By a process
        of careful boot-strapping, highly-intelligent space
        factories were built, as well as colossal dish receivers
        to collect the constant stream of technological data from
        Earth. </p>
        <p>Next came the landings on the target planet, city
        building and making ready for the colonists. And, at the
        same time, preparations for launching more probes and
        survey craft. </p>
        <p>The Terran Expansionary phase was scaled down as time
        passed, and eventually stopped - as far as Earth was
        concerned. Domestic political pressures changed, and
        politicians became more concerned with the quality of
        life for the so-called Free Nations than with space
        exploration. But the starships were in flight, and the
        foundation of the Human Empire was assured. </p>

        <h3>SNOWBALL </h3>
        <p>You play Kim Kimberley, secret agent extraordinaire. </p>
        <p>Your mission: to safeguard the interstar transport,
        Snowball 9, as a last resort following catastrophic
        accident or sabotage. Thus, when your modified
        freezer-coffin wakes you with the Snowball still in
        transit, you know that something must be very wrong.
        You're weakened and disorientated from lengthy
        hibernation, but the fate of two million passengers is in
        your hands! </p>
        <p>Snowball 9 started its journey to the stars from the
        EEC's Ceres base, one of fifty colony starships launched
        in the 2190s. It carried the first colonists for Eridani
        E. </p>
        <p>First to be despatched were the ten giant passenger
        disks, rotating ponderously to provide internal gravity.
        Each was towed gently by a cluster of small tugs and floated
        into the void with 200,000 sleeping colonists on board. </p>
        <p>Then the Snowball's engine unit followed, accelerated
        rapidly by the spectacular flares from its four great
        fusion motors. Like previous launches, and the link-up
        with the disks some weeks later, this was holo'd
        worldwide (though few people bothered to watch). </p>
        <p>Looking like a necklace of sparkling beads, Snowball 9
        headed out into deepest space, and into a century of
        obscurity. </p>
        <p>But the major part of the launch was yet to come - and
        it happened quietly, out of the glare of publicity. The
        chains of accelerators, beyond Pluto, burst erratically
        into life throughout the following three years: firing
        ten-tonne blocks of ammonia-ice at precise speeds after
        the receding craft. Once reeled in by Snowball's
        skyhooks, the ice was built into a huge hollow shell
        around the linked passenger disks. When complete, this
        shielded the disks during the voyage; until the ice was
        finally needed as fuel for the ravening fusion drives. </p>
        <p>The ice-shell - which gave the Snowball series its
        name - formed most of the mass of the completed craft.
        Without the accelerator/skyhook system of &quot;in flight
        refuelling&quot;, realistic-time interstellar voyages
        would not have been feasible. </p>
        <p>As with life, the first thirty years of Snowball 9's
        journey were the most interesting. The computers and crew
        had to catch as much ice as possible before it flew past.
        But even then, there were never more than eight active
        crew at a time. </p>
        <p>Then the starship was left to coast until its
        destination was near, the crew hibernating with the
        passengers. A brief flurry of activity to start
        deceleration, and back to autopilot. Even allowing for
        the great resilience, and hence low sophistication of the
        Snowball's machine intelligences, they are quite capable
        of running everything unaided. No further crew members
        were woken until a year from journey's end. </p>
        <p>The plan from here on was to continue deceleration,
        shed the remains of the ice-shield (by now eaten away to
        insubstantiality by the need for fuel), and dock with the
        target planet, Eden, in geostationary orbit. Finally, the
        passengers would land by glider-shuttle... a process
        taking many years to get everybody down, and
        necessitating the retrieval of grounded gliders by
        sky-hook: the same gliders being used many times. This
        was the plan, anyway... </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in the Eridani star system, the robot
        descendants of the original survey craft that scouted
        Eden have been hard at work. The original crude
        waldroids, directly controlled form the survey craft's
        computers, were good for little other than manual routine
        work. But they have long been superseded by a host of
        specialised robots: highly intelligent and suitable for
        any task. </p>
        <p>Indeed, in the outer reaches of the planetary system
        the first accelerator chains are already being built. It
        will not be long before colonists can leave Eden for
        remoter stars. </p>
        <p>The colonists have taken over a hundred years to reach
        Eden, but the robots can obtain information and
        programming at light speed. They are immeasurably ahead
        of their future 'masters' in knowledge and technology.
        Even if Snowball 9 arrives safely, it is by no means
        certain that the passengers will be able to cope with the
        sudden outdating of all their experience. </p>
        <p>The physical well-being of the colonists is, however,
        assured by the robot's diligent work. Condo's, paveways,
        PYT's, bob nets, pre-ordained work... everything
        necessary for civilised life will be provided. After all,
        why risk further disruption of the social fabric
        resulting from a manifestation of the so-called
        &quot;pioneer spirit&quot;? </p>
        <p>All you, as Kim Kimberley have to do, is to rescue the
        Snowball 9. <a name="siliconreturntoedenscenario"></a> </p>

        <p>You can use punctuation or the word AND to string
        together multiple command. For example... </p>
        <ul>
            <li>OPEN THE DOOR. </li>
            <li>GO SOUTH AND CLOSE THE DOOR. </li>
            <li>GO EAST AND PULL THE GREEN LEVER. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The parser also understands the words ALL and
        EVERYTHING to mean everything moveable that it can see.
        This is an extremely useful time-saving feature. In most
        other adventures, to pick up a number of objects, you
        would have to do the following... </p>
        <ul>
            <li>GET RATCHET </li>
            <li>GET BOLT </li>
            <li>GET CLOTH </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Without using the ALL command, Snowball would
        allow you to use... </p>
        <ul>
            <li>GET RATCHET, BOLT AND CLOTH </li>
        </ul>
        <p>But this can be abbreviated even more simply to... </p>
        <ul>
            <li>GET ALL </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Another useful feature is the ability to refer to the
        last used item/object as IT, for example... </p>
        <ul>
            <li>EXAMINE THE BLUE SWITCH AND PRESS IT </li>
            <li>or... </li>
            <li>GET THE GREEN FLASK AND FILL IT WITH WATER. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Exceptions are also understood by the parser, such
        as... </p>
        <ul>
            <li>TAKE EVERYTHING BUT THE COMPASS </li>
            <li>or... </li>
            <li>EXAMINE ALL EXCEPT THE WATCH </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using all of these command structures allows you to
        type in near-English sentences of great complexity, such
        as... </p>
        <ul>
            <li>EXAMINE ALL BUT THE WATCH, SPANNER AND TORCH AND
                GO EAST. </li>
            <li>DROP EVERYTHING BUT THE FLASK. OPEN IT AND GIVE
                IT TO THE ROBOT. </li>
            <li>GET THE KEYS. OPEN THE SLIDING DOOR AND RUN
                NORTHWEST THEN INVENTORY. WHAT IS MY SCORE? </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Special commands </h3>
        <p>There are a few commands that are neither movement or
        actions. Two of them affect the way the adventure is
        presented to you; they are... </p>
        <table class="table">
            <tr>
                <td>WORDS </td>
                <td>Turn off the pictures. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>PICTURES </td>
                <td>Turn them back on again. </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>A HELP feature has been included, to give you a clue
        at certain points within the three games. The HELP
        command is generally useful in the locations around the
        start of each adventure to get you on your way. </p>
        <p>The other commands are concerned with saving and
        restoring your game position. Full instructions will be
        displayed on the screen where necessary. Those marked
        with an asterisk may not be available on all versions. </p>
        <table class="table">
            <tr>
                <td>SAVE </td>
                <td>Stores game position to your filing system:
                Be sure to have a blank tape or formatted disk
                ready. If you are using cassette, press PLAY and
                RECORD before issuing the command. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>RESTORE [or LOAD] </td>
                <td>Loads a saved game position. Lenslok will be
                needed. Please refer to the Lenslok instructions
                at this time. If you are using cassette, start
                the tape after the Lenslok procedure. [Lenslok
                will *NOT* be needed. Snowball asks for
                words from the Novella as copy protection] </td>

            <tr>
                <td>RAM SAVE * </td>

                <td>Restore position as it was before you last
                moved. OOPS is a very useful command, and
                versions on larger machines let you use it
                several times in succession to go back a long way
                in time. [Warning: OOPS does not work very well
                with timers... the counter counts up one before
                OOPS is done... ie, at the start of Worm in
                Paradise, OOPS will get you less moves every time
                you use it] </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Naturally, you can use OOPS, RESTORE or RAM RESTORE
        even when you have just been killed, so that you can
        return to your position before your fatal accident! </p>

        <h2 align="center">Scoring and Hints </h2>
        <p><a name="silicondreamsscoring"></a> </p>
        <p>Unlike many adventures, you don't score points for
        collecting 'treasures' and storing them in a certain
        location in the game. Instead, you score for doing
        certain things that help you on your way to solving each
        of the adventures. <a name="siliconsnowballscoring"></a> </p>
        <h3>Snowball </h3>
        <p>Your aim is to get to the main control room in the
        engine unit, and rescue the starship from crashing into
        the planet Eden. </p>
        <p>You will lose points for being caught by the
        Nightingales. </p>
        <p>North, south, east, west, etc. are understood in the
        usual way, however, UP and DOWN are relative to local
        gravity. At the start of the game, you are in the lowest
        level of a passenger disk. You will need to go 'up'. <a
        name="siliconreturntoedenscoring"></a> </p>
        <p>Use SAVE and RESTORE regularly throughout the game, as
        well as RAM SAVE/RAM RESTORE and OOPS if they are
        available on your version of the trilogy. </p>
        <p>EXAMining objects will provide helpful clues to
        solving many of the puzzles you will encounter. </p>
